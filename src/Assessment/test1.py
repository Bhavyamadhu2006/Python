# 1. Write an equation that uses multiplication, division, an exponent, addition, and subtraction that is equal to 100.25.

number_value = (2 * 10) + (25/100) + (6 % 23) + (1000/25) + (10-1) + (20/1) + (3*2) - 1
print(number_value)

# 2. Answer these 3 questions without typing code. Then type code to check your answer.
# What is the value of the expression 4 * (6 + 5)
# What is the value of the expression 4 * 6 + 5
# What is the value of the expression 4 + 6 * 5

answer_one = 4 * (6 + 5) #44
answer_two = 4 * 6 + 5 #29
answer_three = 4 + 6 * 5 #34

print(answer_one)
print(answer_two)
print(answer_three)

# 3. What is the type of the result of the expression 3 + 1.5 + 4?
# What would you use to find a numberâ€™s square root, as well as its square?
